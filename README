######## Introduction
######## ------------

Thank you for downloading my addon, Network Management. As 
you may have read on some web pages:

"Netman is an addon that allows you to manage the 
different IRC networks you connect on with mIRC,
since mIRC has multi-server capabilities. You can
add an auto-identify command, usermodes and auto-join
channels for each seperated network."

Enjoy it!



######## -------------------------
######## Installation Instructions
######## -------------------------

1. Unzip all the files contained in "netman.zip" somewhere
   in your hard drive. I suggest you to unzip it in your mIRC
   directory (or inside a folder in your mIRC directory).

2. Open mIRC (Do I really need to write this...?)

3. In your Status Window, type this:

    
   ¦
   ¦  /load -rs path/to/netman.mrc
   ¦
    
   
  ** E.g. If you have unzipped "netman.zip" in "C:\mIRC\", then type
   
     /load -rs C:\mIRC\netman.mrc   

4. Use the popup menu in the Status Window to open the setup dialog,
   or type /netman

5. Send feedback with http://exomel.com/contact/
6. Enjoy Netman!

######## Using Netman
######## ------------

  ## -------------
  ## Add a network
  ## -------------

     1. Click "Add" at the below the main list. Type
     the network name you want to add
     
     2. Click the network name that has just appeared in the main list.
     3. Enter a server that connects to the network you added.
     4. Enter your connection infos (nick, server, fullname, etc.)
     5. Modify the settings you want.
     
  ## ------------------------------   
  ## Remove a network from the list
  ## ------------------------------
  
     1. Click the network name you want to remove in the main list.
     2. Click Delete below the main list.
     3. Click "Yes" if you still want to remove it, or click "No"
     if you no longer want to remove it.
     
  ## ---------------------------------------
  ## Add some channels to the auto-join list
  ## ---------------------------------------
  
     1. Click the network name you want to add channels to.
     2. Selec the "Advanced" tab.
     3. Click the "Add" button under the channels list. Not 
     the one under the networks list.
     4. Type the name of the channel with this syntax:
     
        #channel_name channel_password
        
     Of course, if the channel doesn't have a password, you
     only have to type the channel name.

  ## -----------------
  ## The Login command
  ## -----------------
  
     ** Trick: Use a "." after your command slash,
        to make the command invisible (quiet) to you.
     
     * Notes:
     
      I adapted the login box to be secret-identifiers and input-dialogs compliant
        
        >> So you can have the command
        
          /.nickserv identify $mysecretpass
        
        and the identifier "$mysecretpass" won't be evaluated until the login event. Not
        everytime you open the setup dialog. The password is also not evaluated
        when stored in the .ini file.
        
        >> Also, you can use flexible input dialogs to request for a password input,
        something you normally cannot do . The solution: a 1-millisecond timer doing
        the job. So you can have
        
          /.nickserv identify $input(Enter password,130,Network Management)
        
        as your login command.
        
      Also, if you are in the need to execute multiple commands when connecting, you
      can create an alias doing the commands for you. Example: "/mylogin" as your login
      command. And you add to your "Aliases" tab (ALT+R) :
        
      
        ; My Login Commands
        ; -----------------
                   
        /mylogin {
           
         .nickserv identify my_stupid_password
         .msg myBot login Master my_other_password
          
        }
        ;end
                    
        
      Or, in the Network Management dialog, you can simply seperate the two (or
      Whatever number) commands with a "|".


  ## -----------------------------------
  ## Integrate into Status Windows popup
  ## -----------------------------------
  
    To remove or put back the Netman popup menu in the Status Window:
    
    1. Type /netman
    2. Check/Uncheck the checkbox labeled "Integrate into Status Windows popup"
  
   
    * Note:
    
      If you disable the Netman popup from Status Window, the only way that
      will be possible for you yo open the setup dialog is doing it by typing
      "/netman" in any window. Be careful. No any other popup will be there.


     
  ## ---------------------------
  ## Other functions and options
  ## ---------------------------
  
     Well... I think all the other functions and options are pretty
     instinctive to use. However, if you have any questions or comments
     regarding this addon, send them to remi@exomel.com
